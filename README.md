# Neural Network Challenge 1
Module 18 Challenge

## Overview
In this challenge, I assessed a dataset of student loan data. The dataset included 11 features about 1599 students. I identified the "credit-ranking" column as the target column and created a prediction model to predict if the student would pay off their loan. I was then asked about how I would design a recommendation system to recommend a loan option for these students. 

## Conclusions
Assessing the likelihood of loan repayment benefits loan companies everywhere. It would also benefit the population by reducing debt and increasing credit scores when repayment is full.
